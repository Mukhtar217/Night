            <p class="p">Warriors skills were ranked by the suits they wore. To become a Jaguar or Eagle warrior (Image To The RIGHT), one would have to capture twelve or more sacrifices in two consecutive battles.   </p>

            <p class="p p2">It was viewed as clumsy to kill a man. Strength was slaced based off how good you can captured a man alive, so their fighting style wasn't to kill rather knockout or injury their opponent (Image Below). In the text "The Night Face Up" the main character is captured by the aztecs, he "tried to get up and felt ropes pinning his wrists and ankles. He was staked to the ground on a floor of dank, icy stone slabs... they had carried him to the temple" (pg.73).</p>

            <p id="para">During The Great Famine in 1950 - 1954, The Aztecs beileve that their gods were displeased with them. In order to please their gods the Aztecs planned "Flower Wars" with their main enemy Tlaxcala. The goal of these wars wasn't to kill your enemy or obtain land, but to capture prisoners. With these prisoners the Aztecs preformed many riturals. These riturals and pratices became almost like a sport to the Aztecs. The Aztecs were believed to be far more powerful than the Tlaxcalans, however they never took over Tlaxcala, but rather used it as a farm for human sacrifices. Tlaxcalans disliked the Aztec bullies and delievered the final blow, when they allied with the Spanish in conquering and defeating the Aztec Empire. </p>

            <p class="p">Most human sacrifices consisted of slicing a man's chest open and ripping their beating heart out (Image Above). In the text "The Night Face Up", the main character is about to be a victim of this sacrfice, as stated "they had also picked him up off the ground, someone had approached him also with a knife in his hand" (pg.76)</p>

            <p class="p">These riturals were viewed as ceremonies or a sport and were cheered for among the people (Image To The LEFT). In the text "The Night Face Up", the main character witnesses a man thrown down the steps of the temple, "they pulled off to throw him rolling down the north steps" (pg.76). </p>
